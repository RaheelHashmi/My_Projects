# [**Playback Speed**](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/0/playback/)
Some people have a habit of <strike>lecturing</strike> speaking rather quickly, and it’d be nice to slow them down, a la YouTube’s 0.75 playback speed, or even by having them pause between words.

In a file called `playback.py`, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input, replacing each space with `...` (i.e., three periods).

Here’s how to test your code manually:

  * Run your program with `python playback.py`. Type `This is CS50` and press Enter. Your program should output:
    ```
    This...is...CS50    
    ```
  * Run your program with `python playback.py`. Type `This is our week on functions` and press Enter. Your program should output:
    ```
    This...is...our...week...on...functions 
    ```
  * Run your program with `python playback.py`. Type `Let's implement a function called hello` and press Enter. Your program should output
    ```
    Let's...implement...a...function...called...hello
    ```
