# [**Emojize**](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/4/emojize/)
Because emoji aren’t quite as easy to type as text, at least on laptops and desktops, some programs support “codes,” whereby you can type, for instance, `:thumbs_up:`, which will be automatically converted to 👍. Some programs additionally support aliases, whereby you can more succinctly type, for instance, `:thumbsup:`, which will also be automatically converted to 👍.

See [carpedm20.github.io/emoji/all.html?enableList=enable_list_alias](https://carpedm20.github.io/emoji/all.html?enableList=enable_list_alias) for a list of codes with aliases.

In a file called `emojize.py`, implement a program that prompts the user for a `str` in English and then outputs the “emojized” version of that `str`, converting any codes (or aliases) therein to their corresponding emoji.

Here’s how to test your code manually:

  * Run your program with `python emojize.py`. Type `:1st_place_medal:` and press Enter. Your program should output:
    ```
    Output: 🥇
    ```
  * Run your program with `python emojize.py`. Type `:money_bag:` and press Enter. Your program should output:
    ```
    Output: 💰 
    ```
  * Run your program with `python emojize.py`. Type `:smile_cat:` and press Enter. Your program should output:
    ```
    Output: 😸
    ```
