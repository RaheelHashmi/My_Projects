In `deep.py`, implement a program that prompts the user for the answer to the Great Question of Life, the Universe and Everything, outputting `Yes` if the user inputs `42` or (case-insensitively) `forty-two` or `forty two`. Otherwise output `No`.

42 ------------------> Yes

Forty Two ----------> Yes

forty-two -----------> Yes

50 -------------------> No

Be sure to vary the casing of your input and “accidentally” add spaces on either side of your input before pressing enter. Your program should behave as expected, case- and space-insensitively.
