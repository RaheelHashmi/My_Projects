"""
Suppose that youâ€™re in a country where itâ€™s customary to eat breakfast between 
7:00 and 8:00, lunch between 12:00 and 13:00, and dinner between 18:00 and 
19:00. Wouldnâ€™t it be nice if you had a program that could tell you what to eat 
when?

In meal.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a time and outputs 
whether itâ€™s breakfast time, lunch time, or dinner time. If itâ€™s not time for a 
meal, donâ€™t output anything at all. Assume that the userâ€™s input will be 
formatted in 24-hour time as #:## or ##:##. And assume that each mealâ€™s time 
range is inclusive. For instance, whether itâ€™s 7:00, 7:01, 7:59, or 8:00, or 
anytime in between, itâ€™s time for breakfast.

Structure your program per the below, wherein convert is a function (that can be 
called by main) that converts time, a str in 24-hour format, to the 
corresponding number of hours as a float. For instance, given a time like "7:30" 
(i.e., 7 hours and 30 minutes), convert should return 7.5 (i.e., 7.5 hours).

If up for a challenge, optionally add support for 12-hour times, allowing the 
user to input times in these formats too:

1) #:## a.m. and ##:## a.m.
2) #:## p.m. and ##:## p.m.

7:00 -------------> breakfast time

7:30 -------------> breakfast time

12:42 ------------> lunch time

18:32 ------------> dinner time

11:11 ------------> no output

In addition to the challenge provided above by the official CS50P`s 
opencourseware, I have personally addressed the following edge cases as well:

1) If the user inputs time beyond the time limits such as minutes above 59, or 
hours beyond 12 in 12-hour format or above 23 in 24-hour format, the code will 
explicitly output invalid time.
2) The user might input a.m. or p.m. case insensitively such as A.M. or P.m or 
maybe p.M. Also, the user might input a.m. and p.m.in a different format, like 
without periods as pm or AM. This code will be able to extract the a.m. and p.m. 
information from these types of user inputs.
3) This code also allows for the handling of unnecessary spaces that the user 
might "accidentally" input before, after or even between the useful information 
about time. Like 7:  45  p .m    or    6   : 4  3   a  m.
4) This code will also handle the situation where the user might enter 7:05 as 
7:5 i.e a single digit for minutes less than 10.
