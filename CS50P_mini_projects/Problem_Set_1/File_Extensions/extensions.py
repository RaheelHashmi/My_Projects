"""
Even though Windows and macOS sometimes hide them, most files have file 
extensions, a suffix that starts with a period (.) at the end of their name. For 
instance, file names for GIFs end with .gif, and file names for JPEGs end with 
.jpg or .jpeg. When you double-click on a file to open it, your computer uses 
its file extension to determine which program to launch.

Web browsers, by contrast, rely on media types, formerly known as MIME types, 
to determine how to display files that live on the web. When you download a file 
from a web server, that server sends an HTTP header, along with the file itself, 
indicating the file’s media type. For instance, the media type for a GIF is 
image/gif, and the media type for a JPEG is image/jpeg. To determine the media 
type for a file, a web server typically looks at the file’s extension, mapping 
one to the other.

See 
developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types/Common_types 
for common types.

In a file called extensions.py, implement a program that prompts the user for 
the name of a file and then outputs that file’s media type if the file’s name 
ends, case-insensitively, in any of these suffixes:

1) .gif
2) .jpg
3) .jpeg
4) .png
5) .pdf
6) .txt
7) .zip

If the file’s name ends with some other suffix or has no suffix at all, output 
application/octet-stream instead, which is a common default.

happy.jpg --------------> image/jpeg
document.pdf -----------> application/pdf

Be sure to test each of the other file formats, vary the casing of your input, 
and “accidentally” add spaces on either side of your input before pressing 
enter. Your program should behave as expected, case- and space-insensitively.
