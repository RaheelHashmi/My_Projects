"""
Fuel gauges indicate, often with fractions, just how much fuel is in a tank. For 
instance 1/4 indicates that a tank is 25% full, 1/2 indicates that a tank is 50% 
full, and 3/4 indicates that a tank is 75% full.

In a file called fuel.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a 
fraction, formatted as X/Y, wherein each of X and Y is an integer, and then 
outputs, as a percentage rounded to the nearest integer, how much fuel is in the 
tank. If, though, 1% or less remains, output E instead to indicate that the tank 
is essentially empty. And if 99% or more remains, output F instead to indicate 
that the tank is essentially full.

If, though, X or Y is not an integer, X is greater than Y, or Y is 0, instead 
prompt the user again. (It is not necessary for Y to be 4.) Be sure to catch any 
exceptions like ValueError or ZeroDivisionError.

Hereâ€™s how to test your code manually:

Run your program with python fuel.py. Type 3/4 and press Enter. Your program 
should output:
75% 

Run your program with python fuel.py. Type 1/4 and press Enter. Your program 
should output:
25%

Run your program with python fuel.py. Type 4/4 and press Enter. Your program 
should output:
F

Run your program with python fuel.py. Type 0/4 and press Enter. Your program 
should output:
E

Run your program with python fuel.py. Type 4/0 and press Enter. Your program 
should handle a ZeroDivisionError and prompt the user again.

Run your program with python fuel.py. Type three/four and press Enter. Your 
program should handle a ValueError and prompt the user again.

Run your program with python fuel.py. Type 1.5/3 and press Enter. Your program 
should handle a ValueError and prompt the user again.

Run your program with python fuel.py. Type 5/4 and press Enter. Your program 
should prompt the user again.
